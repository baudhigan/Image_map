    <h1>KAPALEESHWARAR TEMPLE</h1>
    <p>Kapaleeshwarar Temple, located in Mylapore, Chennai, is a revered Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, worshipped here as Kapaleeshwarar, and his consort Parvati, known as Karpagambal. Believed to have been originally constructed in the 7th century CE by the Pallavas, the temple showcases classic Dravidian architecture, featuring a towering 37-meter-high gopuram adorned with intricate sculptures .​</p>
    <p>According to legend, Parvati worshipped Shiva in the form of a peahen at this site, which led to the area's name, Mylapore—derived from 'Mayil,' meaning peacock in Tamil . The temple complex includes a sacred tank, shrines for various deities, and bronze statues of the 63 Saivite saints, known as Nayanars .​</p>
    <p>Kapaleeshwarar Temple is not only a significant religious site but also a cultural landmark, attracting devotees and tourists alike. It is renowned for its vibrant festivals, especially the Panguni Peruvizha, celebrated in March-April, which features a grand procession of deities through the streets of Mylapore .​</p>
